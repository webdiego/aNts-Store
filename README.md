## My process

I started the process of creating my shop starting from the layout design using AdobeXd.
I researched the logo by taking an Australian Aboriginal symbol and used it to create and customize the products in the shop.

After completing the design phase, I moved on to learning and creating a simple API that contained all the details / data of the store that would be collected through the use of React-Query, a new interesting tool to better manage the data.

The whole project was carried out with the sole purpose of practicing using React and TypeScript.
